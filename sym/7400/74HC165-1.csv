# wordswap swaps labels if the pin is on the right side an looks like this:							
"#   ""PB1 (CLK)"". That's useful for micro controller port labels"							
# rotate_labels rotates the pintext of top and bottom pins							
#   this is useful for large symbols like FPGAs with more than 100 pins							
# sort_labels will sort the pins by it's labels							
#   useful for address ports, busses, ...

# tabseparated list of pin descriptions							
#							
# pinnr is the physical number of the pin							
# seq is the pinseq= attribute, leave it blank if it doesn't matter							
# type can be (in, out, io, oc, oe, pas, tp, tri, clk, pwr)							
# style can be (line,dot,clk,dotclk,spacer(only w/o wordswap),none). none if only want to add a net							
# posit. can be (l,r,t,b) or empty for nets							
# net specifies the name of the net. Vcc or GND for example.							
# label represents the pinlabel.							
#	"negation lines can be added with ""\_"" example: \_enable\_ "						
#	"if you want to write a ""\"" use ""\\"" as escape sequence"						
# swap can be (s,) specifies if words in label are to be swapped
